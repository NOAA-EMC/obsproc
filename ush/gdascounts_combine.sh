#  gdascount_combine.sh, merges 4 html files into a single file.
#  The files contain non-sat data counts and 3 sat data counts
#  (received, selected and assimilated).  The resulting html file
#  is sent to the rzdm for display in the GDAS Observational Data
#  counts website.        
#
#  History
#  Ralph Jones   10/04/2005  -  Original version.
#  L. Sager      09/30/2007  -  Modified for operations
#  V. Krishna Kumar 11/15/2008 - Modified to adjust the index html file
#                                for new years
#  D. Stokes  04/2015 Moved to vertical structure package obsproc_prep_post.
#                     Added shebang to run under ksh.  (Since WCOSS transition
#                     this script has been running under bash which does not
#                     capture output from a piped command as expected here).
#                     Removed typeset of variable last so as not to limit it to 
#                     three characters. Similarly, modified sed statement to
#                     prevent corruption of the html file should it reach more 
#                     than 999 lines.  Added checks to reduce risk main page 
#                     corruption if a month is rerun.  Add option to rebuild
#                     complete main page.
#  D. Keyser  05/2015 Split imported script variable $DATCOM1 into separate
#                     input and output variables $DATCOM1_IN and $DATCOM1_OUT
#                     set in parent Job Script.
#                     BENEFIT: Allows checkout runs to specify a production
#                              input location and a local output location.
