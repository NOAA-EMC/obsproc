#
#    This script copies an updated VOS ship list from
#      NDBC and merges the file with a copy of the
#      previous ship_names list
#
# History
#      Steve Lilly 02/01/2016   -  Original script
#      Dennis Keyser 02/12/2016 -  Modifications to put into production
#      Dennis Keyser 05/05/2016 -  If input archive directory .ne. output
#            archive directory and there are no files in output archive
#            directory, then if no changes to files, copy them from input
#            archive directory to output archive directory.
#            BENEFIT:  Allows checkout runs to populate $$VOSarch_OUT even when
#                      there are no file changes.
